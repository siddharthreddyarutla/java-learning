## üß≠ **Kafka Learning Roadmap**

We'll divide everything into **modules**, where each module will have:

* üìò **Conceptual Explanation**
* ‚öôÔ∏è **Technical Deep Dive (with internal mechanisms)**
* üíª **Hands-on Commands (Terminal)**
* ‚òï **Java + Spring Boot Integration Examples**
* üß© **Interview & Real-world Notes**

### üìö **Kafka Module Plan**

| Module | Topic                                    | Description                                                                                        |
| :----- | :--------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1      | **Introduction to Apache Kafka**         | What is Kafka, history, core concepts, and use cases.                                              |
| 2      | **Kafka Architecture Overview**          | Brokers, topics, partitions, producers, consumers, and clusters.                                   |
| 3      | **Kafka Topics & Partitions (Hands-on)** | Creating topics, understanding partitioning, replication, and leaders/followers.                   |
| 4      | **Producers**                            | Producer internals, acknowledgments, batch handling, idempotence, retries, and delivery semantics. |
| 5      | **Consumers & Consumer Groups**          | Consumer offset management, rebalancing, and polling mechanisms.                                   |
| 6      | **Kafka Broker Internals**               | Broker configurations, zookeeper/KRaft role, and log segment structure.                            |
| 7      | **Kafka Rebalancing & Fault Tolerance**  | How consumers rebalance, partition assignment strategies, and recovery mechanisms.                 |
| 8      | **Kafka in Java (Core API)**             | Implementing a producer and consumer using Kafka Java Client.                                      |

Would you like me to begin **Module 1: Introduction to Apache Kafka** now?
(It will include concept, real-world analogy, architecture basics, and why Kafka is so widely used ‚Äî all in Markdown format.)
