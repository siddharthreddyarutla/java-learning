# Design Patterns — Overview & Roadmap

[Reference Link](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/)

## What we’ll cover (major, interview + dev-useful)

We’ll group them and go in this order (recommended):

**Creational (how objects are created)**

* Singleton
* Factory Method
* Abstract Factory
* Builder
* Prototype

**Structural (how classes/objects are composed)**

* Adapter
* Bridge
* Composite
* Decorator
* Facade
* Proxy
* Flyweight (brief)

**Behavioral (communication between objects)**

* Strategy
* Observer (Publish/Subscribe)
* Command
* Iterator
* Template Method
* State
* Chain of Responsibility
* Mediator
* Visitor (overview)
* Memento (brief)

**Architectural & Utility patterns (practical for projects/interviews)**

* Dependency Injection (pattern vs frameworks)
* Repository / DAO
* MVC / MVVM (high-level)
* Null Object
* Service Locator (with caveats)

---

## How each module will be presented (same structure as OOP/SOLID)

For **each** pattern you’ll get:

1. **Definition & intent** (why it exists)
2. **Problem it solves** (when to use)
3. **Bad (anti-pattern) example** — simple Java that shows the pain
4. **Good example** — clear, compile-ready Java (careful about thread-safety where relevant)
5. **Real-world analogy** (concrete)
6. **When *not* to use it / pitfalls** (overuse / anti-pattern cautions)
7. **Testability notes & how it helps**
8. **Small exercises** you can try locally
9. **Common interview questions** focused on the pattern
