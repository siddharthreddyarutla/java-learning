Excellent question — and you’re right to notice the **similarity** — both **Factory Method** and **Template Method** patterns involve inheritance and abstract methods.
But they solve **different problems** 👇

### ⚙️ **Key Difference**

| Aspect                  | **Factory Method**                                                               | **Template Method**                                                               |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Goal**                | To **create objects** (decide which subclass to instantiate)                     | To **define an algorithm’s structure** and let subclasses customize certain steps |
| **Focus**               | Object **creation**                                                              | Algorithm **execution**                                                           |
| **What’s fixed**        | Object creation flow, but *which class to instantiate* is deferred to subclasses | Algorithm sequence (order of steps)                                               |
| **Customization point** | Subclasses decide *which object to return*                                       | Subclasses override *specific steps* of the algorithm                             |
| **Return type**         | Usually returns a new object (factory product)                                   | Usually performs a series of operations                                           |
| **Example analogy**     | “Which car model should I build?” 🚗                                             | “How do I assemble a car?” ⚙️                                                     |
| **Example in Java**     | `Calendar.getInstance()`, `DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance()`                 | `HttpServlet.service()` → `doGet()` / `doPost()`                                  |

### 🧠 **In short:**

* **Factory Method → focuses on object creation.**
* **Template Method → focuses on defining process flow.**

Or simply:

> 🏭 **Factory = “Which object to create?”**
> 🧱 **Template = “How to execute the steps?”**
