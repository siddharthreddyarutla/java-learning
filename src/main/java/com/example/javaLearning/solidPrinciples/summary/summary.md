# 📝 SOLID Principles — Recap & Summary

## 1️⃣ **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

* **Definition**: A class should have only **one reason to change** (one responsibility).
* **Goal**: Separation of concerns.
* **Example**:
  ❌ `ReportManager` does report creation, saving, emailing.
  ✅ `ReportGenerator`, `ReportSaver`, `EmailService` (split classes).
* **Analogy**: In a restaurant → Chef cooks, Waiter serves, Cashier handles money.
* **Abstraction?**: Not central, but can help if responsibilities vary.

---

## 2️⃣ **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**

* **Definition**: Classes should be **open for extension but closed for modification**.
* **Goal**: Add new features without changing existing code.
* **Example**:
  ❌ `AreaCalculator` with `if-else` for Circle, Rectangle, Triangle.
  ✅ `Shape` interface → new shapes just implement `Shape`.
* **Analogy**: A smartphone OS doesn’t change for new apps; apps extend its capabilities.
* **Abstraction?**: Core enabler (interfaces, inheritance).

## 3️⃣ **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**

* **Definition**: Subtypes must be **substitutable** for their base types.
* **Goal**: Maintain behavioral correctness when using inheritance.
* **Example**:
  ❌ `Ostrich` extends `Bird` but throws error on `fly()`.
  ✅ Separate `Bird` and `Flyable` interfaces.
* **Analogy**: A key substitute must work like the original; a “car key” shouldn’t be given as a “house key.”
* **Abstraction?**: Essential → define correct contracts for substitution.

## 4️⃣ **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**

* **Definition**: Clients should not be forced to depend on **methods they don’t use**.
* **Goal**: Small, focused interfaces.
* **Example**:
  ❌ One fat `Machine` interface with `print()`, `scan()`, `fax()`.
  ✅ `Printer`, `Scanner`, `Fax` interfaces separately.
* **Analogy**: Separate menus in restaurants (veg, non-veg, drinks) instead of one giant confusing menu.
* **Abstraction?**: Core → split big abstractions into small ones.

---

## 5️⃣ **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

* **Definition**: High-level modules should depend on **abstractions, not concretes**.
* **Goal**: Decoupling, flexibility, testability.
* **Example**:
  ❌ `Application` depends on `MySQLDatabase`.
  ✅ `Application` depends on `Database` interface (could be MySQL, PostgreSQL, Mock).
* **Analogy**: Wall socket (standard interface) works with many devices (TV, fan, charger).
* **Abstraction?**: Core → everything depends on interfaces.

# 📊 Abstraction’s Role in SOLID

| Principle | Role of Abstraction            |
| --------- | ------------------------------ |
| SRP       | Not necessary, just separation |
| OCP       | Key enabler                    |
| LSP       | Key enabler                    |
| ISP       | Entirely abstraction-focused   |
| DIP       | Entirely abstraction-focused   |

👉 4 out of 5 SOLID principles **directly rely on abstraction**.

# 🎯 Why SOLID Matters

* **Maintainability**: Easier to understand & modify.
* **Extensibility**: Add features safely.
* **Testability**: Mocks & stubs become easy.
* **Flexibility**: Swap implementations with minimal change.
* **Scalability**: Large teams can work on different modules independently.

# 🧑‍💻 Interview Quickfire (one-liners)

1. **SRP** → One class, one reason to change.
2. **OCP** → Extend without modifying existing code.
3. **LSP** → Subclasses must honor parent contracts.
4. **ISP** → Small, focused interfaces; no fat interfaces.
5. **DIP** → Depend on abstractions, not concretes.
