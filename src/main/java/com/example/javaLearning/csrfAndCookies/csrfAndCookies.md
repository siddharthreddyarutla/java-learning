## 🍪 **1. Cookies — what & why**

### 🔹 What is a Cookie?

A **cookie** is a small piece of data (key–value pair) stored on the client’s browser, sent by the server to maintain **session state** or other data between requests.

> HTTP is stateless — cookies make it *stateful*.

---

### 🔹 How it works (simplified flow)

1. **User logs in**

    * Browser sends credentials → server validates.
2. **Server creates a session**

    * Generates a **session ID** and stores it in memory/database.
3. **Server sends back cookie**

    * Example HTTP response:

      ```
      Set-Cookie: JSESSIONID=abc123; Path=/; HttpOnly; Secure
      ```
    * Browser saves this cookie.
4. **Browser sends cookie automatically**

    * For every subsequent request to that domain:

      ```
      Cookie: JSESSIONID=abc123
      ```
    * This tells the server which session belongs to which user.

### 🔹 Cookie types

| Type                  | Description                                                                       |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Session Cookie**    | Temporary, deleted when browser closes (e.g., JSESSIONID).                        |
| **Persistent Cookie** | Has an expiry date; used for “remember me” features.                              |
| **HttpOnly**          | JavaScript **cannot access** it (protects against XSS).                           |
| **Secure**            | Sent only over HTTPS.                                                             |
| **SameSite**          | Prevents cookies from being sent during cross-site requests (helps prevent CSRF). |

---

### 🔹 Why cookies are important

✅ Maintain login sessions.
✅ Track user preferences.
✅ Essential for authentication.
⚠️ But also a **security target** — can be stolen (via XSS) or misused (via CSRF).

---

## 🛡️ **2. CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)**

### 🔹 What is CSRF?

CSRF is an attack where a **malicious website tricks a logged-in user’s browser** into making **unwanted requests** to another site where the user is authenticated.

---

### 🔹 Example of CSRF attack

Imagine you’re logged into your bank at:

```
https://mybank.com
```

You have a valid session cookie:

```
Cookie: SESSION=abc123
```

Now you visit a malicious website that has hidden HTML:

```html
<form action="https://mybank.com/transfer" method="POST">
  <input type="hidden" name="to" value="attacker">
  <input type="hidden" name="amount" value="1000">
  <input type="submit">
</form>
<script>document.forms[0].submit();</script>
```

👉 Since the browser **automatically includes cookies** for `mybank.com`,
your bank receives the forged POST request as if *you* made it.

✅ Cookie is valid → server processes it → attacker gets money.

---

### 🔹 Why this happens

* Browser automatically sends cookies for that domain.
* Server only checks cookies to verify session, not who initiated the request.

---

## 🧩 **3. CSRF Token — how it protects you**

To defend against this, the server issues a **CSRF token** (a random secret) that must be included in every state-changing request.

---

### 🔹 How it works

1. **User loads page**

    * Server sends an HTML form with a hidden token:

      ```html
      <input type="hidden" name="_csrf" value="a9f6c3b1-xyz...">
      ```
    * Token is unique per user/session.

2. **User submits form normally**

    * Browser sends cookie + token:

      ```
      Cookie: JSESSIONID=abc123
      Form data: _csrf=a9f6c3b1-xyz...
      ```

3. **Server validates token**

    * It compares token with one stored in the user’s session.
    * If token matches → request is valid.
    * If token missing or invalid → reject as CSRF attack.

4. **Malicious sites fail**

    * Attacker can’t read the token (it’s not accessible cross-origin).
    * Their forged request will **not include the correct CSRF token**.

---

### 🔹 When CSRF token is generated

* When a user **creates a new session** (e.g., login, first page load).
* It’s stored server-side (in session or cache).
* Sent to the client via:

    * Hidden `<input>` in HTML forms, **or**
    * A custom **header** (for APIs, e.g. `X-CSRF-TOKEN`).

---

## 🔐 **4. Spring Security — how it handles CSRF**

In Spring Boot:

* CSRF protection is **enabled by default** for form-based logins.
* It adds a token to every form automatically:

  ```html
  <input type="hidden" name="_csrf" value="generated-token"/>
  ```
* For AJAX/REST APIs, you send it as a header:

  ```js
  fetch('/api/transfer', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'X-CSRF-TOKEN': csrfToken },
    body: JSON.stringify({...})
  });
  ```

Spring validates token automatically before processing POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE requests.

---

### 🔹 Example (Spring Security config)

```java
@Override
protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http
        .csrf() // enabled by default
        .and()
        .authorizeRequests()
        .anyRequest().authenticated();
}
```

To disable (for APIs with JWTs or tokens):

```java
http.csrf().disable();
```

## ⚙️ **5. Cookie + CSRF working together**

| Component               | Purpose                                                              |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cookie (Session ID)** | Identifies and authenticates the user.                               |
| **CSRF Token**          | Ensures the request is intentionally made by that user (not forged). |

Both are used together:

* Cookie proves *who* you are.
* CSRF token proves *you* initiated the action.

---

## 🧠 **6. Summary**

| Concept        | Purpose                                | When generated                | Security role            |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Cookie**     | Store session info (e.g., login state) | After login or first response | Authentication           |
| **CSRF Token** | Prevent cross-site request forgery     | On session creation           | Authorization validation |

---

✅ **In short:**

> * **Cookies** keep you logged in.
> * **CSRF tokens** make sure *you* are the one making the request.
